### Project management

Our projet is based on an actual prototype application which uses indoor position system  called "KANA". The most difficult part in this project is the brainstorming, coming up with new ideas to provide better solutions for the outdated prototype.





We ourself find it quite easy to devide the workload, which is everyone will do some parts on his/her own and some parts we will do together. We have some difficults in finding times to work together due to our different timetables, somehow we managed to solve that issue by working after school time. We usually communicated with each oher through mail to update and keep the project on going. We were a great team and I hope we can work together in the next project.





Estimation working hours: in average each member spent about 15 hours.
