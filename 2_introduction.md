### This is the chapter introducion

* Describe here the background and motivation for your project

  Everybody has different background and motivation. As to me, I study business IT program. So I know a little bit business and a little bit IT . Nothing good at:-/. I 've heard from other student that there would be one course to teach student use PHP and the  course name seems to be software engineering. That' s why I enrolled it. Now I found it would not offer any php issue in the course. However another interesting I found. To learn how to use GIT. That's why  I am still here :-)

* Why this project, what was the need for the system?

  I did not read through yet the whole instructions from teacher. Too many pages:-D. But I guess it teach student how to get fimilar with revision control skills. That's very important. I used several times with other student to do some kinds of team work with Gdrive. With Gdrive everybody can do the work but there is no branches there. 

* Overall description of the system

  * What it is

    ? To describe the git system I guess? Here is one explaination got directly from wikipedia.

    Git (/ɡɪt/[3]) is a distributed revision control and source code management (SCM) system with an emphasis on speed,[4] data integrity,[5] and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.[6] Git was initially designed and developed by Linus Torvalds for Linux kernel development in 2005, and has since become the most widely adopted version control system for software development.[7]

  * What it is for, what the users can do with it?

    The above answered question seems suit for this question too. There are many terms in Git. Still could not remember so much yet. But the basic ideas seems to be either you create a new repository and the other people could fork it and make their own modifications. If they would like to push it back, they send push request and if it is accepted by the master, the master will pull it back. This is just one example. However we could see a picture from this function, everybody could works on their own if they wish. They could make their own modification without change the original ones by accident. If several people would like to work together, it would be very convienient.
