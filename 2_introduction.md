#1. Introduction

####Description of our project
Mr Olli has shown us a prototype application which uses indoor position system built by metropolia students.It's available in google play known as ['KANA'] (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fi.metropolia.jokketest&hl=en) which is under development process.The current app is completely outdated and our team has decided to continue the development process of the  app.Therefore we are implementing new fetures and fixes to the current app.

####CampusSeek
The CampusSeek project is a new software product intended for use on mobile with Android platform. While the CampusSeek application is the main focus of our project, we also need a server where all the process of storing database and synchronization will be implemented. The CampusSeek system will have 2 main components: a mobile application which will run on moibles using Android platform, and a server-side application which will support and interact with mobile application. This system is desiged to allow users to track other users activites and places. Potential scenarios include tracking firends or teacher, showing how to get to the tracked users by providing Indoor Positioning Systems,etc. Users can also have option to hide their position to keep privacy when they need.
