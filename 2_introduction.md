### This is the chapter introducion

#### Introduction
 * Hi my name is Nguyen Thai Binh and I want to introduce briefly about my project and my team. My team project is to write a requiremetns documentation of an indoor positioning system. This project is a part of our course "Software Engineering". That is quite an intersting project and it is desinged to work in a group of 2-3 members. In the spirit of the project, we decided to work as a 3-members team. We decided to name out team as "Prometheus", which is a name of a Titan in Greek mythology. The members of "Prometheus" team includes: 
  * Nguyen Thai Binh, student id: 1403735
  * Nguyen Dung Phuong, Student ID: 1304949
  * Midhat Hasan Raghib, Student ID: 1304947
 * We have discussed with each others and also with Mr Olli and finally came up with the idea to build a mobile software called "CampusSeek". 

#### Overall description
 **1. Product perspective**
  * The CampusSeek project is a new software product intended for use on mobile with Android platform. While the CampusSeek application is the main focus of our project, we also need a server where all the process of storing database and synchronization will be implemented. The CampusSeek system will have 2 main components: a mobile application which will run on moibles using Android platform, and a server-side application which will support and interact with mobile application. This system is desiged to allow users to track other users activites and places. Potential scenarios include tracking firends or teacher, showing how to get to the tracked users by providing Indoor Positioning Systems,etc. Users can also have option to hide their position to keep privacy when they need.
